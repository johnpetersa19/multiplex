## Overview

Vintangle is an app to watch torrents together, similar to how Netflix and Amazon Prime provide a watch party service.

It enables you to ...

- **Stream any torrent**: By utilizing the mpv video player, Vintangle has support for a wide range of video and audio formats.
- **Synchronize playback between remote peers**: Thanks to [weron](https://github.com/pojntfx/weron), Vintangle can be used to host online watch parties by synchronizing playback position, magnet links and other data between peers.
- **Circumvent BitTorrent protocol censorship**: By splitting the core [hTorrent backend](https://github.com/pojntfx/weron) and UI into two separate projects, Vintangle can be used without having to connect a client to the BitTorrent protocol.

## Installation

Vintangle is distributed as a Flatpak. You can install it by running the following:

```shell
# Stable
$ flatpak remote-add vintangle --from "https://pojntfx.github.io/vintangle/flatpak/stable/vintangle.flatpakrepo"
# Unstable
$ flatpak remote-add vintangle --from "https://pojntfx.github.io/vintangle/flatpak/unstable/vintangle.flatpakrepo"
$ flatpak install -y "com.pojtinger.felicitas.vintangle"
```

It will update automatically in the background.
